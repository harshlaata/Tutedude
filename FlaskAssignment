1. Create a Flask application with an /api route. When this route is accessed, it should return a JSON list. The data should be stored in a backend file, read from it, and sent as a response.
2. Create a form on the frontend that, when submitted, inserts data into MongoDB Atlas. Upon successful submission, the user should be redirected to another page displaying the message "Data submitted successfully". If there's an error during submission, display the error on the same page without redirection.

Submission Guidelines -: Attach Screenshots or command along with explanation and submit in doc(google doc or microsoft doc) format also attach github repo link

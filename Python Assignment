1. Grade Checker
Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.

Ans:

score = int(input("Enter your score: "))

if score >= 90:
    print("Grade: A")
elif score >= 80:
    print("Grade: B")
elif score >= 70:
    print("Grade: C")
elif score >= 60:
    print("Grade: D")
else:
    print("Grade: F")


2 Student Grades
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing studentâ€™s grade.
Print all student grades.

Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:

Ans:
student_grades = {}

while True:
    print("\nChoose an option:")
    print("1. Add new student")
    print("2. Update existing student's grade")
    print("3. Print all student grades")
    print("4. Exit")

    choice = input("Enter your choice (1-4): ")

    if choice == "1":
        name = input("Enter the student's name: ")
        grade = input("Enter the grade for " + name + ": ")
        if name in student_grades:
            print(name + " already exists. Use update option to change the grade.")
        else:
            student_grades[name] = grade
            print(name + " added successfully.")

    elif choice == "2":
        name = input("Enter the student's name to update: ")
        if name in student_grades:
            grade = input("Enter the new grade for " + name + ": ")
            student_grades[name] = grade
            print(name + "'s grade updated successfully.")
        else:
            print(name + " does not exist.")

    elif choice == "3":
        if not student_grades:
            print("No student records.")
        else:
            print("Student Grades:")
            for name in student_grades:
                print(name + ": " + student_grades[name])

    elif choice == "4":
        print("Exiting program.")
        break

    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter a number between 1 and 4.")




3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.

Using file functions like write and open.

Ans:
file = open("example.txt", "w")

file.write("Hello, this is a sample file.\n")
file.write("This file is created using Python.\n")
file.write("File handling is easy with open() and write().")

file.close()

print("File created and content written successfully.")




4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.

Ans:
file = open("example.txt", "r")

content = file.read()

print(content)

file.close()
